This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Just like matplotlib, plotly is an open source graphics library. It also helps the programmer to perform nice visual representations with Python, JS or R.

The skill displayed in this repository is PLOTLY.
